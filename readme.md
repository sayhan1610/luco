## Features — Or: What’s Scooping? 🍨 ~~(I'm hoping it'll help count the scoops)~~

1. Footer on every page because consistency is key.
2. Bubbly CSS animations in the background — bubbles, bubblesss, _bubblin’_.
3. Images that scale up on hover — cos size _does_ matter sometimes.
4. Tooltip texts for sneaky tips when you hover
5. Buttons you can actually click ~~(not like your ex’s promises)~~.
6. `<a href>` links.
7. CSS tilt on hover and enlarge on hold for images on `day.html`.
8. Clean, organized HTML lists to keep things neat.
9. Unique CSS styling throughout.
10. Multipage design, because one page is never enough (Luco’s got stories to tell).
11. Click-to-save images on `adventures.html`.
12. Hover animations on `crew.html`.
13. Neon faded glow on two crew members because some peeps gotta shine brighter than others.
14. A dedicated 404 page that’s basically the Bermuda Triangle.
15. Easter egg in 404.html (with a little JavaScript).
16. Custom imported font from google.

### What is this?

It’s Luco’s personal website for all his loyal fans — the _cool kids_ who want a slice of underwater internet magic and maybe some free virtual ice cream (spoiler: no actual ice cream, but we’re working on teleportation tech).

### Can I do it too?

If you’re under 19 or still in high school - absolutely!
Check out [swirl.hackclub.com](https://swirl.hackclub.com) and get your own scoop.

### What’s the purpose?

Because swirl.hackclub.com was giving free ice cream vibes, and honestly, why not? Plus, this site is a smooth blend of slick style, playful animations, and hidden shark fins lurking to surprise you.

### What’s the _real_ purpose?

Shhh… it’s actually a dope template for your own portfolio, team, or org page. You want to look fresh, professional, but with a cheeky splash? This is it.
(Also, maybe just a sneaky excuse to flex on your friends with some confetti and shark fins.)
